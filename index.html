            <p>It's been (one week since you looked at me...sorry I had to.) a heck of a ride<br>going through Lambda.
                I still can't believe that I'm doing this program and actually getting the hang of coding.
                I hope I'm not speaking too soon when I say that I enjoy doing this kind of work. To think for the longest time<br>
                I was against learning anything about coding but here I am now, creating websites! (At least with HTML and CSS so far)</p>
